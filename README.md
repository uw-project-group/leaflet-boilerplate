_Optional instructions for those who wish to use Node to run the server locally with BrowserSync:_

Node is used in this project for front end package management.

1. Install Node. (If using a Linux or Unix OS, use Node Version Manager https://github.com/creationix/nvm so that you can hook into the `.nvmrc` file for automated Node version management goodness.) 

2. Clone repo and install Node modules: `npm install`.

3. Start browser using npm start script: `npm run start-sync`.
